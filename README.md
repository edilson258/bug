# Bug Language

Bug is a stack-based programming language with a functional paradigm, developed for educational purposes.

The program written in bug language is compiled by the bug compiler (`bugc`) to an intermediate bytecode and serialized to a file, then the Bug Virtual Machine (`bvm`) loads the file containing the bytecode and execute.

### Hello, world!

`hello.bug`
```code
fn main() void -> "Hello, world!" @write;
```
### More examples
1. `sum two integers`
```
fn sum(int lhs, int rhs) int -> lhs rhs +;
fn main() void -> 34 35 @sum @write;
```
